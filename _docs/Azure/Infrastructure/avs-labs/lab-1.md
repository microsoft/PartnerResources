# LAB1 – Azure VMware Solution Deployment

Azure VMware Solution Deployment Lab

Since the deployment is an important step in the end-to-end process you will be
using a VMware Hands-On Lab (HoL) to understand and follow the steps required
for the deployment. This HoL provided by VMware is not a live Azure environment,
it’s a simulation. So, you’ll follow the steps as is without being able to
change configurations.

In this lab, you will get an overview of Azure VMware Solution. You will go
through the steps to deploy a Private Cloud, connect the private cloud to an
Azure Virtual Network, and access vCenter for your Azure VMware Solution private
cloud.

> You’ll need to register (create an account) at VMware Hands-On Lab platform
> to access the lab.  
>  
> The instructions on how to register at VMware Hands-On Lab platform will be
> provided during the training if needed. Feel free to ask for them anytime.
> Registration is Free.
