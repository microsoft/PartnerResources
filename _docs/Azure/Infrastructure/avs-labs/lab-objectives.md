# Lab Objectives

In this lab you are going to learn how to connect to Azure VMware Solution to
manage it and configure enterprise integrations. You will learn how to configure
the foundation of AVS to make it ready for the hosted workloads. In addition,
you will learn how to integrate and use some of the Azure services from
workloads deployed in vSphere running on Azure VMware Solution. Specifically, we
are going to deploy a VM in AVS and have it securely and privately access Azure
Blob Storage service, later, we will configure the VM as a web server, enable
public access to it and for last, the basics on how to deploy an Application
Gateway as load balancer in front of it.

You can also experience AVS deployment and VMware HXC Migration, which are
optional to the scope of this training, but they are highly recommended to go
through. VMware has provided simulation labs for each of them. These labs are
available 24/7 and are sperate from the lab environment given in this training.
You’ll see them in LAB-1 and LAB12B.
