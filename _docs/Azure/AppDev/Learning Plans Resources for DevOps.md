# Learning Plan Resources for DevOps

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is the combination of development (dev) and operations (ops) - it's the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers. Just as the [assembly line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line) transformed automobile production in the 1900s, DevOps is the critical foundation needed to standardize, automate and accelerate software development. 
Learn more DevOps fundamentals in the [DevOps Resource Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/what-is-devops).

## What is Microsoft's DevOps strategy?
[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) has empowered 1000s of enterprises for 15+ years with rich features to support developer innovation, standardization and automation. 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the planet's largest developer platform...home to 65+ million developers who build software collaboratively. GitHub brings an open source culture that improves communication, sharing of knowledge and code reuse.
Our strategy is to bring the best of both products together into a single product experience - in GitHub - to provide the broadest set of software development capabilities that meet the needs of every developer and enterprise. Azure DevOps will continue to evolve with the industry, and we are committed to supporting and investing in Azure DevOps while we execute on our strategy. 

## GitHub or Azure DevOps?
When evaluating GitHub or Azure DevOps, we encourage you to:
- Explore GitHub and its unique capabilities like [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), [Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security), [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).
- Move/create your repo in GitHub - even if you plan to use Azure [Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/boards/) or [Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) - to take advantage of [code & secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security), [vulnerability alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies), [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) and [innersourcing](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/).
- [Integrate Azure Boards with GitHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/?view=azure-devops) and leverage Azure [Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/) and [Test Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/test-plans/) in conjunction with GitHub as needed.
- ISVs should consider [creating GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions) to provide integrations with GitHub. You can learn more in this [GitHub for ISVs Tech Talk](https://msuspartners.eventbuilder.com/event/45411).
- Review GitHub's [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/projects/1) to see/track upcoming features.

NOTE: Tools to migrate from Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Travis CI and Circle CI are coming soon. These tools will perform a best-effort attempt of a migration with a goal of converting 80% of the constructs of a pipeline. Stay tuned!

## Deployment Options
GitHub provides the following deployment options:
- [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://github.com/enterprise) - cloud-based deployment with security and compliance features
- [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/overview/system-overview#security) - self-hosted deployment with security and compliance features
- [GitHub AE](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/admin/overview/about-github-ae) - a fully managed service, hosted in a highly available architecture for customers who have stringent security and compliance requirements.
