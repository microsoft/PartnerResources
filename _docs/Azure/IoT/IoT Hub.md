# Learning Plan Resources for Azure IoT Hub

#### ***This page was retired on 06/06/2024***

Use IoT Hub to build your IoT application with two-way communication, enabling highly secure and reliable communication between your Internet of Things (IoT) application and the devices it manages. Azure IoT Hub provides a cloud-hosted solution back end to connect virtually any device. Extend your solution from the cloud to the edge with per-device authentication, built-in device management, and scaled provisioning.
* Security-enhanced communication channel for sending and receiving data from IoT devices
* Device Update for IoT Hub enables over-the-air deployment of updates to help keep IoT devices up to date and secure
* Full integration with Azure Event Grid and serverless compute, simplifying IoT application development
* Compatibility with Azure IoT Edge for building hybrid IoT applications
