# Learning Plan Resources for Azure Digital Twins

Companies are exploring Digital Twins as a mechanism to control and monitor connected environments. A digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world environment that is driven with data from business systems and IoT devices. It is used to enable insights and actions for a business or organization. Developers and architects are looking to digital twins as the solution that enables intelligent and connected environments such as the following:
* Predictive maintenance in manufacturing
* Supply chain visibility
* Smart shelves for real-time inventory
* Connected homes and smart buildings
