# Learning Plan Resources for SQL Server Migration to Azure

This learning plan aggregates content for understanding and successfully migrating databases into Microsoft Azure. Specifically, this plan covers the migration of relational databases, primarily SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, and MariaDB, with a specific emphasis on SQL Server because of the number of deployment options available.

In any database migration, it is important to have the source system documented in order to evaluate target options. For the source system, a minimum amount of information needed includes:

* Overall system size (CPU/RAM/IO subsystem), current usage, and version
* Architectural diagram showing database layout and interconnectivity.  This includes cross database connectivity, ETL processes, and any feature usage such as transactional replication.
* Security requirements: information on account types (for example, Azure AD), encryption requirements (such as TDE)
* BCDR requirements: clustering, high availability, georeplication, etc. - having defined RPO (recovery point objective) and RTO (recovery time objective) numbers are essential.

With this information, options can be evaluated for both cost and technical feasibility. For example, a large server with many interconnected databases will likely be a better fit for Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, whereas a server with dozens or hundreds of independent databases will likely be a better fit for Azure SQL Database (singleton) with Elastic Pools.

Content is broken down as follows:

* Fundamentals, Associate, Expert, Specialist: content categorized in increasing level of complexity
* Certifications: relevant Microsoft exams or certifications
* Community resources: user groups, events, blogs

## Fundamentals

_The single best resource is the Microsoft Online Migration Guide, as it allows you to select both source and target systems and see prescriptive guidance:_

* [Microsoft Online Migration Guide](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/)
