## Certifications
DP-100 applies your knowledge of data science and machine learning to implement and run machine learning workloads on Azure; in particular, using Azure Machine Learning Service. This is the most Machine Learning heavy certification. 
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-100

You may also consider taking AI-100 to skill up on cognitive services, machine learning, and knowledge mining or DP-200 and DP-201 to skill up on the data engineering portion of a machine learning project.
