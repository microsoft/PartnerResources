# Learning Plan Resources for Azure OpenAI

> This document is under active development. Please check regularly for updates.

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI is a collaboration between Microsoft Azure and OpenAI, a leading research organization in artificial intelligence.
It is a cloud-based platform that enables developers and data scientists to build and deploy AI models quickly and easily.
With Azure OpenAI, users can access a wide range of AI tools and technologies to create intelligent applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning.

Azure OpenAI is designed to accelerate the development of AI applications, allowing users to focus on creating innovative solutions that deliver value to their organizations and customers.
