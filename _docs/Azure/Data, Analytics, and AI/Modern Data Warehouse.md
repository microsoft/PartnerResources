# Learning Plan Resources for Modern Data Warehouse (Azure Synapse Analytics)

Azure Synapse Analytics is an analytical service evolved from Azure SQL Data Warehouse that brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. Provisioned or on-demand, Azure Synapse offers a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for analytics, BI, and machine learning needs.

Below you will find content to assist in upskilling in Azure Synapse. Because the product is rapidly evolving, some documentation may reference Azure SQL Data Warehouse, or refer to features that are in-preview and not yet released. Content is broken down as follows:

* Keeping Up: latest information and links 
* Fundamentals, Associate, Expert, Specialist: content categorized in increasing level of complexity
* Certifications: relevant Microsoft exams or certifications
* Community resources: user groups, events, blogs

Additionally, some content may be marked with one or more icons:

* '$' to indicate paid content
* '3rd Party' to indicate 3rd party content (not created by Microsoft)

## Certifications

Exams such as the [70-767 Implementing a Data Warehouse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-767.aspx) are still available, however we recommend the new role-based certifications as these better align to industry trends and the mix of technical skills needed to successfully build Data & AI solutions.

Although DP-200 and DP-201 are similar, DP-200 focuses more on the "How?" solutions are implemented, typically requiring code/scripting experience and knowledge of how to enable certain features.  DP-201 focuses more on the "Why?" -- understanding how different components work together.

* [Exam DP-200: Implementing an Azure Data Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-200)
* [Exam DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-201)

Both of these exams are required for the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-engineer?wt.mc_id=learningredirect_certs-web-wwl) certification.

* [Exam DP-203: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure (beta)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-203)
 * Exams DP-200 and DP-201 will be replaced with exam DP-203 on February 23, 2021.
