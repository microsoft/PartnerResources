title: Securing Critical Networks with Microsoft Defender for IoT and Horizon DPI
sorttitle: 10
description: With the Open Development Environment (ODE), you will be able to quickly support 100% of protocols used in OT, IoT and ICS environments (including custom or proprietary protocols that are not to be shared with the outside world). Deep packet inspection in the Defender for IoT platform can be easily extended by developing plug-ins that use the Horizon ODE for deep packet inspection. A patent has been granted to Microsoft for innovative, ICS-aware threat analytics and machine learning algorithms relating to OT/IoT/ICS security.
