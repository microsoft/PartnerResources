Welcome to the Modern Analytics Academy (MAA) - Data Governance with Azure Purview!

Data Governance is defined as the people, processes, and technology needed to securely and properly handle data across an organization. Azure Purview has been designed to help curate, identify, and manage that data, whether it be on-premises, in Azure, or in another cloud.

In the main session, we'll explore Azure Purview's main features, with a number of demos and examples for you to explore on your own. In addition, we're providing additional content to help in related topics, as we can't get to it all in a single session (coming soon).

## Hands-on Content

Each module contains several options for hands-on learning. In most cases, there are multiple options available designed to meet your specific skilling needs, from simple tutorial/demo content to more advanced workshops. We understand that some people may just want to see demos while others want to dive deep; most are somewhere in between. Use the content that best suits you!
