# Copilot for Security Resources

## What is Copilot for Security? 🤔

We first introduced Copilot for Security at the inaugural Microsoft Secure. Microsoft Copilot for Security is the first security product to enable defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI. It combines the most advanced large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI with a Microsoft-developed, security-specific model.

If you have an existing NDA with Microsoft, join our **[Microsoft Copilot for Security Limited Customer Connection Program (CCP)](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_XAVZ7AP_VPg7dX-69WxXdUQ1ZNUUVQOFNZOUtVSzdTNTFCMUEyQkVUQi4u).**

See our **[Microsoft Security Academy](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-security-academy)** for more video sessions, demos, and other related materials created and delivered by architects across the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) security-aligned team and beyond.

## Feb. 2024 Update📰

**Prepare for Copilot for Security's March launch with our new [Copilot for Security documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/).**

Prompt engineering is critical for Copilot for Security to create specific, high-quality outputs. **[This folder](https://github.com/rod-trent/Security-Copilot/tree/main/Prompts)** contains Copilot for Security prompting templates and Promptbooks.


## Get Started

To get started, we recommend watching the following videos created by Microsoft Security and the Global Partner Solutions (GPS) Technical Team:

## Features

* Incident Response — Summarize incidents, assess impact, and receive tailored remediation guidance based on proven strategies.
* Security Posture Management — Learn if your organization is at risk from vulnerabilities and examine resources in your environment for signs of a breach.
* Security Reports — Summarize investigations, incidents, vulnerabilities, or threats in minutes and prepare the information in ready-to-share reports.

#### Considerations

* **Assist a Human in Completing Work** – It's a Copilot, integrations are driven by/drive human engagement, not background runtime processing of substantial amounts of data.
* **Have High Customer Value** — The cost of Generative AI is orders of magnitude per transaction higher than your average feature today and depend on a constrained hardware supply (GPUs).
* **Will be Regularly Used** — The best integrations will be used regularly so it is ongoing value, not a one-time value (like a configuration assistant).
* **Work with Constrained Context** — The model has a token limit for both input and output for the entire session.
* **Leverage Model Creativity** — The model is probabilistic and not deterministic; the best integrations are cases where that is additive to the user experience.
