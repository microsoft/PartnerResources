## Microsoft Adaptive Cloud Academy

Microsoft Azure offers many ways for customers to build, deploy, operate, and secure their application and data estates, including customer on-premises assets and even customer assets running in other cloud providers. [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-arc) is at the core of enabling this **[adaptive cloud](https://arcjumpstart.com/adaptive_cloud)** approach to customer requirements.

Effectively, Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane to on-premises or multicloud customer infrastructure, allowing operators to manage, operate and secure their [servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview) and [Kubernetes clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/overview) all through tools like Azure portal and Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. Azure management features like [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/arc-enabled-servers/eslz-management-and-monitoring-arc-server), [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/policy-reference), and [Update Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/update-manager/overview?tabs=azure-vms) are also available on-premises via Azure Arc.

If you are a Microsoft services partner and you have not incorporated Azure Arc into your toolset then you are missing customer opportunity. Reach out to your Microsoft partner team to learn more about how we have helped partners use Azure Arc as part of their cloud managed services, migration, and application development practices.
