Microsoft Viva Sales is a seller experience, an application, which leverages Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to automatically capture, access, and register data into any customer relationship management (CRM) system.

**Configure Viva Sales** in your Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement demo environment to highlight how sellers can become more productive within their customer relationship management (CRM) application. 

These two videos provide pre-sales engineers guidance on how to **configure** and **demonstrate** the integrated experience between Viva Sales, Dynamics 365 Sales, Teams and Outlook.
