Journeys can be triggered based on real-world interactions. Trigger-based customer journeys enable Marketers to react to customers’ actions in real-time. Whereas Segment-based journeys are used to create outbound journeys like sending out announcements or a nurture campaign.

The real-time nature of the journey ensures that Marketers can respond to customers immediately and convert their expression of interest into a sale.
