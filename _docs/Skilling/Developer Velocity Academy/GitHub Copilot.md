# Developer Velocity Academy — GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the **Developer Velocity Academy — GitHub Copilot.**

{% include_relative pagenav.md %}

## GitHub Copilot 

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It integrates with popular code editors to provide real-time code suggestions, autocompletions, and even entire code blocks based on the context of the code being written. By utilizing machine learning and a vast repository of code, GitHub Copilot aims to enhance developer productivity and streamline the coding process.

**GitHub Copilot Chat** is an innovative chat interface developed by GitHub, enhancing the traditional Copilot experience with interactive dialogue capabilities. Integrated within Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, it allows developers to engage in conversations about their code directly. This AI-driven feature understands and responds to coding-related queries, offering explanations, suggestions, and solutions. Whether it's about syntax, debugging, test cases, or programming concepts, Copilot Chat provides coding assistance through natural language interactions, simplifying the process of navigating documentation and forums.

## GitHub Copilot Enterprise

**GitHub Copilot Enterprise** enhances the standard Copilot experience with features that accelerate developer velocity beyond coding. It deeply integrates with your organization's codebase, allowing developers to streamline code navigation and comprehension, and enabling faster feature implementation, issue resolution, and code modernization. Copilot Enterprise also includes a chat feature within GitHub.com for accessing organizational knowledge and documentation, and it facilitates faster pull request reviews with automated summaries. These enhancements help developers be happier and more productive.

## GitHub Copilot Extensions

**GitHub Copilot Extensions** introduce a powerful capability that integrates various tools and services directly. This allows seamless interaction with multiple platforms without leaving the IDE or GitHub.com. Initially partnering with companies like DataStax, Docker, Microsoft Azure, MongoDB, and more, these extensions enable developers to manage tasks like error monitoring, database management, and deployment using natural language through Copilot Chat.
