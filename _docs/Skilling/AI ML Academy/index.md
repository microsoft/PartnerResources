# AI & ML Academy

## Content

Welcome to the AI and ML Academy (AIA)! This academy includes 6 modules, all of which build on top of each other. It incorporates technical assets as well as best practices. We include common AI/ML scenarios that we have seen throughout various industries. The objective of the academy is to help you all move faster and build effective solutions. The modules are:

## Table of Contents

The structure of the content is represented in the table below; the overview session is a high level overview focusing on concepts and principles, while each of the 'module' sessions, Pre-Built AI through MLOps, will be more in-depth. Each session will contain one or more presentations, with several suggested labs and workshop content in each module designed to accomodate various skill levels and time availability.

Refer to links below for the module breakouts.

## Hands-on provisioned Environments

We are not currently offering fully-hosted lab environments for AI & ML Academy, but this may change in the future as we expand the content. In the meantime, you can still run the labs in your own Azure subscription. These labs are listed below:
