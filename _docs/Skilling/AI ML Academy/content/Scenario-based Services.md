# AI & ML Academy - Scenario-based Services 

Welcome to the AI & ML Academy - Scenario-based Services!

In this module, we’ll look at Scenario-based services, including Document Intelligence, Metrics Advisor, Azure AI Search, Video Indexer, Personalizer, Anomaly Detector, and Power Virtual Agents. 

## Scenario-based Services 

### Document Intelligence

Document Intelligence, formerly known as Form Recognizer, is an AI service that applies advanced machine learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately. Turn documents into usable data and shift your focus to acting on information rather than compiling it.

#### Conceptual

* [The AI Show -Ep52: Analyze unstructured docs and more with Azure Document Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cZgYJdRGc) - This is a great resource to understand Document Intelligence capabilites and updates.
* [Applied AI Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-applied-ai-blog/bg-p/AppliedAIBlog/label-name/Form%20Recognizer) - A place to ask any questions you may have about Document Intelligence as you work on your solutions.

Updates 

* [Build Recap: The Newest Features from Azure Document Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1dEJMoFeus) - A great place to see the new features for Azure Document Intelligence.


### AI Search 

AI Search, formerly known as, Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to help you identify and explore relevant content at scale. Use cognitive skills for vision, language, and speech, or use custom machine learning models to uncover insights from all types of content.

### Metrics Advisor

Metrics Advisor is a part of Azure Applied AI Services that uses AI to perform data monitoring and anomaly detection in time series data. The service automates the process of applying models to your data, and provides a set of APIs and a web-based workspace for data ingestion, anomaly detection, and diagnostics, without needing to know machine learning.
