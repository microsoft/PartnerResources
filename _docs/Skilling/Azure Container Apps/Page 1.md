# Workshop Template

Welcome to the Workshop Template!

Use each page to add content for each relevant section of the workshop. This might be based on topic, day, or other logical grouping.

This template is meant to be copied and used as a starting point for building a workshop or other skilling series. This is a great page to start with, adding an overview section and then filling out however many subpages are needed. You may need more, or fewer, pages.

Any embedded resources that needed to added to the repo directly, such as PPTX or images, should be housed in the root assets folder in a subfolder with a short name. For example, Modern Analytics Academy has content in /assets/maa/filename.pptx; this is necessary to support Github pages deployment. Ideally, video content should be embedded or linked to. See the Modern Analytics Academy for samples on how to do this.

__Important!__ Don't forget to update the 'front-matter' at the top of the document (the content between ---). Update the name and permalink -- remember each page needs a unqiue permalink. See how the template simply addes to the permalink with the sub page name.

## Table of Contents

If your workshop or series has an agenda or table of contents, add that here.
