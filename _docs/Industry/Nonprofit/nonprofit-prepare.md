# Prepare to grow your business with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit

Microsoft Tech for Social Impact integrates philanthropy and affordable commercial sales to accelerate impact through technology. This includes providing grants and discounts across cloud products including Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365, as well as for industry-specific solutions included in Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit. This partner readiness material is designed for new and existing partners as they build and grow a business with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit - our premier solution for the nonprofit sector.

Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit aligns the capabilities of Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Azure, and LinkedIn to address common nonprofit scenarios including constituent engagement and fundraising, staff collaboration and volunteer management, and program design and delivery. Together with our partners we are aiming to double the number of nonprofits we work with to over 600,000 by 2027.

## Partner success
Above all, the success of our partners is reflected in [customer stories](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=&ff=story_industry_friendlyname%26%3ENonprofit&p=3&so=story_publish_date%20desc).
For our partners working with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit the opportunity is shaped by:
 - The nearly 300,000 nonprofits Microsoft works with today globally.
 - The technology grants and discounts Microsoft offers to nonprofits.
 - The growth in demand for secure, modern, integrated technologies from customers that see the value in the end-to-end platform capabilities of the Microsoft Cloud.
 - Additional demand for fundraising and volunteer management solutions in adjacent industries including healthcare and higher education.

### Setup your internal environment
Creating an internal deployment of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit not only ensures familiarity with the process, but also sets you up for continued use for future sales demonstrations. We recommend going through the setup process with someone from technical sales, as well as someone from the solution delivery team.

#### Pre-production licenses

Next, a user with Global Administrator role for the partner tenant may request additional free or discounted non-production licenses using the [Non-production Environment License Portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/requestlicense/) with the following considerations:
 - A single submission can include multiple licenses for the selected offer type.
 - A payment method may be requested during when adding the Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit license, however, it is a $0 SKU and there is no charge.
