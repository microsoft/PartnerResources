# Prepare to grow your business with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit
Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit aligns the capabilities of Microsoft 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Azure, and LinkedIn to address common nonprofit scenarios including constituent engagement and fundraising, staff collaboration and volunteer management, and program design and delivery. Together with our partners we are aiming to double the number of nonprofits we work with to over 600,000 by 2027.

## Partner success
Above all, the success of our partners is reflected in [customer stories](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=&ff=story_industry_friendlyname%26%3ENonprofit&p=3&so=story_publish_date%20desc).
For our partners working with Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit the opportunity is shaped by:
 - The nearly 300,000 nonprofits Microsoft works with today globally.
 - The technology grants and discounts Microsoft offers to nonprofits.
 - The growth in demand for secure, modern, integrated technologies from customers that see the value in the end-to-end platform capabilities of the Microsoft Cloud.
 - Additional demand for fundraising and volunteer management solutions in adjacent industries including healthcare and higher education.

## Get started
Here is an overview of the fastest possible path to working with customers of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit:
 1. Create a free partner account with the [Microsoft Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership).
 1. Prepare for development or demonstrations with [a pre-production environment](#setup_internal).
 1. Grow your business through [co-selling opportunities and marketplace offers](./nonprofit-grow.md#grow).

These activities will be referred to frequently throughout the readiness materials.

### Setup your internal environment[]{#setup_internal}
Creating an internal deployment of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit not only ensures familiarity with the process, but also sets you up for continued use for future sales demonstrations. We recommend going through the setup process with someone from technical sales, as well as someone from the solution delivery team.

#### Pre-production licenses
Start with the [Microsoft Action Pack](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/action-pack) for a baseline of partner materials and support that includes cloud licenses for several prerequisites of Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit: Azure Credit, Microsoft Office 365, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement.

Next, a user with Global Administrator role for the partner tenant may request additional non-production licenses using the [Non-production Environment License Portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/requestlicense/) with the following considerations.

NOTE: You can select multiple licenses for a single submission.
