# Learning Plan Resources for Dynamics 365 Field Service

Dynamics 365 Field Service is a Microsoft business application helps organizations deliver onsite service to customer locations. The application combines workflow automation, scheduling algorithms, and mobility to set mobile workers up for success when they're onsite with customers fixing issues.  Field Services ensures the right person, with the right skills and parts, shows up at the right place and right time to improve first-time fix rate, customer satisfaction, and resource productivity. 

Connected Field Service enables organizations to transform the way they provide service from a costly break-fix model to a proactive and predictive service model through the combination of IoT diagnostics, scheduling, asset maintenance, and inventory on the same platform.
