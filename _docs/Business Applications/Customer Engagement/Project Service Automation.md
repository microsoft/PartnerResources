Upgrade from Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation to Dynamics 365 Project Operations

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-project-operations/upgrade-dynamics-365-project-service-automation-dynamics-365-project-operations

Project Operations is powerful on its own, but also expandable by our customers who require additional capabilities from Dynamics 365, including Marketing, Human Resources, Customer Service, and more. Whether you want the additional functionality of another Dynamics 365 application or to add on a custom application built with Power Apps, everything works together and works like you expect because they share a common foundation—and the security, privacy, and compliance of a cloud-delivered solution.
