# Customer Data Platform Learning Plan Resources

Welcome to the Microsoft US One Commercial Partner (OCP) Learning Plan Resources repository for the Customer Data Platform

## What are Learning Plan Resources?

Learning plan resources consist of curated content to help upskill across solution areas: Azure, Modern Workplace and Business Applications.  

Each solution area is broken down into specific topic areas with specific learning plan resources within each topic. This should make it easy to find the upskilling materials for your areas of interest.

The curated content for each topic consists of fundamental to expert resources to satisfy the needs of anyone that is interested in increasing their knowledge and skills. The resources include links to blogs, documentation, hands-on labs, learning paths, tutorials, videos, webinars and more.

Content is broken down as follows:

* Fundamentals, Associate, Expert, Specialist: content categorized in increasing level of complexity
